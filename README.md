## 4Cast4Football

4Cast4Football is a project made to get weather for NFL Football games. I created this project with the thought of creating something that could be useful for my favorite sport. I correlated a free weather resource with a free sports data resource. Using the data I am able to create posts or tweets for each NFL game. Curently I have to post the tweets manually because of issues with the Twitter API character limit issues. This is why I created a website as well using the same data.
